## DGX 670: Your Lo-Fi Keys Source

### Best Sounds for Lo-Fi

| Sound | DGX Preset | Lo-Fi Use |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| Electric Piano | FM E.Piano, DX E.Piano | Rhodes chords, melancholy |
| Strings | Slow Strings | Pad layers, intros |
| Organ | Jazz Organ | Warm beds |
| Synth Pad | Warm Pad | Atmosphere |
| Piano | Mellow Grand | Sampled chops |

### Recording from DGX

1. **Play into MPC** (normalled path, no cables needed)
2. **Sample phrases, not single notes** - lo-fi is about feel
3. **Play slightly off-grid** - human imperfection = warmth
4. **Use sustain pedal** - let notes bleed into each other

### Lo-Fi DGX Processing Chain
```
DGX 670 → OctoPre Dynamic (2-3 dB compression)
       → MPC (sample)
       → Lexicon A (plate reverb, medium decay)
       → VLA (gentle warmth)
       → Print
```

## MiniFreak: Your Lo-Fi Texture Machine

### Best Sounds for Lo-Fi

| Type | MiniFreak Approach | Use |
|------|-------------------|-----|
| **Detuned leads** | 2 oscillators, slight detune | Warbly melodies |
| **Dusty pads** | Noise + filter + LFO | Background texture |
| **Wobble bass** | LFO on filter cutoff | Underwater bass |
| **Vinyl crackle** | Noise oscillator, filtered | Layer under everything |
| **Tape warble** | Slow LFO on pitch | Instant lo-fi |

### MiniFreak Lo-Fi Preset Ideas

**Warbly Keys:**
```
OSC1: Virtual Analog (Saw)
OSC2: Virtual Analog (Saw, detuned +7 cents)
Filter: Low-pass, cutoff 60%, resonance 20%
LFO1 → Pitch (rate: slow, amount: subtle)
```

**Dusty Pad:**
```
OSC1: Wavetable (soft)
OSC2: Noise (filtered)
Filter: Low-pass, cutoff 40%
Amp Envelope: Slow attack, long release
FX: Chorus (subtle)
```

**Vinyl Texture:**
```
OSC1: Noise
OSC2: Off
Filter: Band-pass, cutoff sweeping slowly
Volume: Low (background layer)
```

### Recording from MiniFreak
```
MiniFreak → OctoPre Dynamic (control peaks)
         → MPC (sample long phrases)
         → Golden Age EQ (roll off highs at 8kHz)
         → Print with character
```

## MPC: The Brain

### Lo-Fi MPC Techniques

| Technique | How | Why |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| **Pitch down samples** | -2 to -5 semitones | Slowed, dreamy |
| **Bit crush** | 12-bit or lower | Gritty texture |
| **Time stretch artifacts** | Stretch without warp | Glitchy character |
| **Vinyl sim** | Layer crackle sample | Dusty vibe |
| **Swing** | 55-62% MPC swing | Human groove |
| **Chop & flip** | Slice samples, rearrange | Classic lo-fi |

### Lo-Fi Drum Programming

**Kick:** Soft, round, slightly boomy
```
Sample: Vintage drum machine or vinyl rip
Processing: VLA (light compression), roll off highs
```

**Snare:** Dusty, crackly, not too bright
```
Sample: Layered with noise/foley
Processing: Golden Age EQ (cut above 6kHz)
```

**Hi-hats:** Thin, filtered, tucked back
```
Sample: Real hats or shaker
Processing: Low-pass filter in MPC
```

**Groove:**
```
Swing: 58%
Velocity variation: 70-100 (not robotic)
Timing: Slightly behind the beat
```

## Outboard Processing for Lo-Fi

### The VLA-2 (Your Warmth Machine)

**Lo-Fi Settings:**
```
Compression: Opto mode
Attack: Slow (let transients through)
Release: Medium
Ratio: 3:1
GR: 3-6 dB
```

**Use on:** Full mix, keys, pads

**Result:** Smooth, warm, rounded edges

---

### The VCA Bus (Your Glue)

**Lo-Fi Settings:**
```
Attack: Medium-fast
Release: Auto
Ratio: 2:1
GR: 1-3 dB
```

**Use on:** Drum bus, full mix

**Result:** Cohesive, punchy but controlled

---

### The Lexicon A (Your Space)

**Lo-Fi Reverb Settings:**
```
Type: Plate or Room
Decay: 1.5-2.5 seconds
Pre-delay: 20-40ms
High cut: 4-6kHz (dark reverb = lo-fi)
Mix: 30-50% wet
```

**Use on:** Keys, vocals, snare

**Result:** Dreamy, distant, nostalgic

---

### The Lexicon B (Your Time)

**Lo-Fi Delay Settings:**
```
Type: Tape delay or analog
Time: Tempo-synced (1/8 or dotted 1/8)
Feedback: 30-50%
High cut: 3-5kHz (each repeat gets darker)
Mix: 20-40% wet
```

**Use on:** Melodies, vocal chops, percussion

**Result:** Dub vibes, depth, movement

---

### The Golden Age EQ (Your Color)

**Lo-Fi Settings:**
```
Low shelf: +2 dB at 100Hz (warmth)
High shelf: -3 dB at 8kHz (tape roll-off)
```

**Use on:** Everything (subtle)

**Result:** Vintage frequency response

---

### The Ultragraph (Your Sculpting)

**Lo-Fi Settings:**
```
Cut 2-4kHz: Reduce harshness
Boost 200Hz: Add body
Cut above 10kHz: Remove digital sheen
```

**Use on:** Full mix, drums

**Result:** Shaped, analog-feeling tone

---

## Lo-Fi Beat Workflow

### Step 1: Capture Source Material

**Keys (DGX 670):**
```
Play 8-16 bar chord progressions
Use Rhodes/EP sounds
Let it breathe, don't rush
Record through OctoPre Dynamic (light compression)
Sample into MPC
```

**Textures (MiniFreak):**
```
Create warbly, detuned patches
Record long evolving textures
Add noise layer for vinyl feel
Sample into MPC
```

### Step 2: Chop & Arrange in MPC

```
Slice samples to pads
Play with swing (58%)
Layer drums underneath
Keep it simple: 4-8 tracks max
```

### Step 3: Process Through Outboard

**Drums:**
```
MPC OUT 7-8 → VCA Bus (punch)
           → Golden Age EQ (shape)
           → Return to MPC
```

**Keys/Chords:**
```
MPC OUT 3-4 → VLA (warmth)
           → Lexicon A (space)
           → Return to MPC
```

**Melody:**
```
MPC OUT 5-6 → Lexicon B (delay)
           → Golden Age EQ (roll off highs)
           → Return to MPC
```

### Step 4: Mix Through VLA

```
MPC OUT 1-2 → VLA (final warmth)
           → Print or record to DAW
```

## Quick Session Template

```
Track 1-2: Drums (MPC internal + VCA processing)
Track 3-4: Bass (MPC internal)
Track 5-6: Keys/Chords (DGX → VLA → Lexicon A)
Track 7-8: Melody (MiniFreak → Lexicon B)
Track 9-10: Texture/Noise (MiniFreak noise patch)
Track 11-12: Vocal chops (if any, → Lexicon A)

Master: → VLA (2-3 dB warmth) → Print
```

## Golden Rules

1. **Sample, don't sequence** - Play real instruments, sample the feel
2. **Commit early** - Print the processing, don't save for later
3. **Imperfection is the point** - Off-grid, detuned, filtered = lo-fi
4. **Less is more** - 4-6 elements max, leave space
5. **Dark > bright** - Cut highs everywhere
6. **Analog > digital** - Use outboard, avoid plugins
7. **Vibe > perfection** - If it feels right, it is right
